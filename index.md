### About Me

I'm Kevin, an undergrad currently pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. This site is an outlet for my thoughts and place where I can show off my work.

Wan to check out what I'm working on? My projects are usually open-source and viewable on my [Github](https://github.com/kvchen/). This semester, I'll be helping out as a TA and developer for [CS61A]({{ site.url }}/cs61a), along with serving as an officer of [Hackers@Berkeley](http://hackersatberkeley.com/).

Outside of work, I love reading science fiction, watching anime, and scaling the leaderboards in [mindless rhythm games](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/keffcat). I've also been trying to pick up Smash, knitting, and cooking, only one of which might be of some use in the forseeable future.


### About the Site

This site is built on the popular Ruby blogging platform [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). All the code used in generating this content is fully [open-source](https://github.com/kvchen/kvchen.github.io/tree/source).
