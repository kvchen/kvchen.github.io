### About Me

I'm Kevin, an undergrad currently pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Want to check out what I'm working on? My projects are all free, open-source, and viewable on my [Github](https://github.com/kvchen/).

This semester, I'll be helping out as a TA and developer for both [CS61A]({{ site.url }}/cs61a) and [CS161]({{ site.url }}/cs161). I've also been trying to pick up Starcraft II, knitting, and cooking, only one of which might be of some use in the forseeable future.

If you're trying to get in touch, my email's <a href='ma&#105;lto&#58;%&#54;&#66;ef&#102;cat&#64;&#103;%&#54;D&#97;&#105;l&#46;com'>ke&#102;fcat&#64;gmai&#108;&#46;com</a>. If you wish to encrypt your communications, my GPG key ID is [`0x07D49A39BB63A8CD`](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x07D49A39BB63A8CD).
