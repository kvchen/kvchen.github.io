I'm Kevin, a recent graduate from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program at UC Berkeley. I'm currently working at Facebook at a software engineer and pursuing a part-time masters degree from Stanford.

In the past, I've helped out as a TA and developer for [CS61A]({{ site.url }}/cs61a), [CS161]({{ site.url }}/cs161), and [CS184](https://cs184.org/). Want to check out what I'm working on now? My projects are all free, open-source, and viewable on my [Github](https://github.com/kvchen/).

If you're trying to get in touch, my email's <a href='ma&#105;lto&#58;%&#54;&#66;ef&#102;cat&#64;&#103;%&#54;D&#97;&#105;l&#46;com'>ke&#102;fcat&#64;gmai&#108;&#46;com</a>. If you wish to encrypt your communications, you can find my identities and public keys (including PGP) on [my keybase](https://keybase.io/kevinchen).
