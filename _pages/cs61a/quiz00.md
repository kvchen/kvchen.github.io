There's a hallway with 100 closed lockers against the wall, lined up in a row. You begin by opening every locker, such that every locker is now open. Then, you go to every second locker and close it. Next, you go to every third locker and _toggle_ it - that is, you open it (if it's closed) and close it (if it's open). You continue this same process - toggling every fourth locker, then every fifth locker, and so on. After 100 passes (on the last one, you should only toggle locker 100), how many lockers are open?

{% endproblem %}

Expected value is defined as the average value of a series of outcomes, weighted by the probabilities of their occurrences. That is,

{% math %}
\mathbb{E}[X] = x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 + \cdots + x_np_n
{% endmath %}

For instance, the expected value of a dice roll is 3.5, since

{% math %}
\frac{1}{6}(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 3.5
{% endmath %}

Your TA walks up to you in section and asks if he can play a game of chance. Instead of calling him a scam and running away, you decide to hear him out. The rules are as follows:

* You have the option to throw a die up to three times.
* You will earn the face value of the die in dollars.
* You have the option to stop after each throw and walk away with the money earned.

What is the expected payoff of this game (assuming you play optimally)?
