Expected value is defined as the average value of a series of outcomes, weighted by the probabilities of their occurrences. That is,

{% math %}
\mathbb{E}[X] = x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 + \cdots + x_np_n
{% endmath %}

For instance, the expected value of a dice roll is 3.5, since

{% math %}
\frac{1}{6}(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 3.5
{% endmath %}

Your TA walks up to you in section and asks if he can play a game of chance. Instead of calling him a scam and running away, you decide to hear him out. The rules are as follows:

* You have the option to throw a die up to three times.
* You will earn the face value of the die in dollars.
* You have the option to stop after each throw and walk away with the money earned.

What is the expected payoff of this game (assuming you play optimally)?
