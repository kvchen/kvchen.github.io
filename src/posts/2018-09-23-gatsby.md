There are a lot of static site generators these days. Jekyll seemed to be the most popular back when I was in college, but other systems have since popped up: Hugo is a big one, and Pelican has also gained some popularity. Each generator is always tightly coupled to a particular language: Jekyll uses Ruby, Hugo uses Go, and Pelican uses Python.

I've wanted to switch from Jekyll for a while now, mostly because I was never fluent in Ruby and that made writing plugins a huge challenge. I recently saw on HackerNews that [Gatsby released v2.0.0](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-17-gatsby-v2/), and I'd never heard of it. Turns out it uses GraphQL and React and makes it super easy to get started. I was able to follow the tutorial and get a site up and running in a matter of minutes.

### Flow Typing

My team at work uses Flow for static typing Javascript applications, and I've gotten used to all the benefits that provides: catching errors before they go to production, jump to definition, and a whole bunch of other stuff. We also use Relay for GraphQL Javascript apps, which has a compiler that generates Flow types as a part of parsing GraphQL queries.

However, turns out that Gatsby is missing this particular feature, and that causes all GraphQL queries to be untyped. Not good!

To fix this, I used the Flow-type codegen utilities from [Apollo's CLI](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cli). This allows me to pass in a target glob and extract Flow types into a folder of my choice. I created a script that I call from my `package.json`:

```bash
rm -f src/codegen/graphql/* && \
    apollo schema:download --endpoint http://localhost:8000/___graphql gatsby-schema.json && \
    apollo codegen:generate --tagName=graphql  --target=flow --useFlowExactObjects --useFlowReadOnlyTypes --queries='./src/**/*.js' --schema=./gatsby-schema.json --outputFlat src/codegen/graphql
```
